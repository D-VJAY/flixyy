# FLI-XY (an OTT Platform)

This is my first Collage project

**OverView** 
## why and What is an OTT platform?
An OTT (Over-The-Top) platform is a streaming service that delivers video content over the internet, allowing users to watch on-demand content without traditional cable or satellite TV. Examples include Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+.

## About this project
FLI-XY which is an OTT platform ,is my first sort of full-Stack MERN project.

The idea behind this project is to create a free to use OTT platform , So that anyone can access it form any where.

Also there is no need to create an account for the user to use it,So it will not be an hassle for the one's who is not very good at using technologies.

# Important point regarding this project

* This Project  may be a full stack project,but while pushing it on git hub ,i'm not using "Connecting this Project to the database", as it can cause a connection problem with the DataBase" ,so i suggest you to connect your own DB,and add your own data,by following the pattern of "data.json file".

## Future scope/Improvements that can be Done in the FLI-XY

**1 Enhancing UI/UX**

UX is one of the most Important and crucial aspect of a Platform ,as it helps user to understand things better and to attract their attention towards our website.

 **2 Movies Recomendation based on previos user Data**

 This is One of the major Features which I would like to add in  our FLI-XY App as it will help user to find movies based on their Movie Taste.
